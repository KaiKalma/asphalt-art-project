# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled.
For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

My project uses algorithms to paint a sun, a pyramid, and a UFO shooting a laser beam at the pyramid. It includes 1 superclass of PainterPlus, a subclass of that called MuralPainter, and 2 subclasses of that called
PyramidPainter and CloudPainter.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

Two things in my project that I am proud of is my idea for it because it is very unique. I am also proud of how I made the pyramid look like it had a shadow because it made it look much more detailed.
3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

Something that I would do differently is making my paintLine method work properly. Since it was broken due to my choice of a 32x32 grid, and I did not have time to talk to Mr. Eillo, I ended up having to code most of the
sun and UFO by hand.
